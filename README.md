# Bamazon-Storefront

### Customer View 

The app prompts the customer with two messages.

   * The first should ask them the ID of the product they would like to buy.
   * The second message should ask how many units of the product they would like to buy.

Once the customer has placed the order, the app will check if the store has enough of the product to meet the customer's request.

   * If not, the app will inform them that there is an insufficent quantity in stock. They will be prevented from making a purchase.

However, if the store _does_ have enough of the product, the customer's order will be fulfilled.
   * The SQL database will be updated to reflect the remaining quantity.
   * The customer will be shown the total cost of their purchase after the completed transaction.
